Structured Decision Making (SDM) System:
The SDM System is a collection of evidence-informed tools designed to support child welfare professionals at key points throughout a child abuse or neglect case. Rather than making decisions for social workers, SDM offers a structured way to gather and interpret information, encouraging critical thinking to improve decision-making quality.
SDM relies on standardized definitions to ensure fairness, accuracy, and consistency. Social workers are urged to read each definition fully and carefully, whether through WebSDM’s question mark icons, the Evident Change SDM manual, or via mobile access at https://ca.sdmdata.org/definitions.
Key practice reminders include:
Always refer to item definitions to match family information appropriately.
Pay attention to the logical connectors ("and," "or," "and/or") in definitions.
Provided examples are illustrative, not exhaustive.
Don’t confuse “unasked” questions with “unknown” answers.
Use sound judgment—when uncertain, seek input from peers or supervisors.
SDM tools serve as guides, not replacements, for sound practice. They should be used alongside the Integrated Core Practice Model (ICPM), which outlines the values and behaviors guiding quality social work practice.
Hotline Tools – Purpose and Use
The Hotline Tools are designed to help determine whether a child welfare referral meets the legal criteria for an in-person CPS investigation. If the threshold is met, the tools also guide how urgently a social worker should respond—such as immediately or within five days. For referrals that don’t warrant a CPS investigation, the tools assist screeners in deciding if a referral to community-based services is a more suitable response.
Safety Assessment – Purpose and Practice
The Safety Assessment is used to evaluate whether a child is currently at risk of immediate and serious harm and to identify what protective actions are necessary. It helps workers determine if the child is Safe, Unsafe, or Safe With Plan. When "Safe With Plan" is the outcome, a formal Safety Plan must be created.
During investigations, social workers are encouraged to structure their interviews using the SDM Safety Assessment framework. This approach supports consistent, accurate, and timely evaluations of child safety.
Risk Assessment – Purpose and Use
The SDM Risk Assessment is a research-based tool that helps identify families more likely to experience future child welfare involvement within 18 to 24 months. It supports decision-making on whether ongoing intervention is needed by evaluating current circumstances and past history. Though it doesn't predict future maltreatment directly, it assesses the likelihood of recurrence in the absence of agency involvement.
The tool categorizes risk into Low, Moderate, High, or Very High, with clear differences in recurrence rates. Families identified as High Risk are statistically more likely to have future referrals or substantiated reports than those assessed as Low Risk.
Reunification Reassessment – Purpose and Use
The Reunification Reassessment helps determine whether children in out-of-home care with a reunification goal should return home, remain in placement with continued services, or shift to a different permanency plan. This SDM tool guides staff in evaluating a family’s progress on case plan goals and comparing current conditions to earlier safety and risk levels. Research shows that following the tool's recommendations reduces the likelihood of future harm and reentry into care.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR
SDM ASSESSMENTS

WHO IS BEING ASSESSED WITH EACH SDM ASSESSMENT?
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
• SDM assessments are household-based (see definition of household in the glossary).
• Each SDM assessment reflects a single household.
• If a child’s caregivers do not live together, the child may be a member of two households.
• Household composition may change over time. Each SDM assessment reflects the child’s current
household at the time of that assessment.
DETAILED CONSIDERATIONS
• If a child’s legally responsible caregivers do not reside together, the child is a member of two
households: one with each legally responsible caregiver.
• If a child resides in a household with no legally responsible caregiver, the child is a member of two
or three households: one where the child primarily resides, and one with each legally responsible
caregiver.
• If a minor is a parent, the minor parent is a member of two or three households: one with the minor
parent and their child (and any others in that household), and one with each legally responsible
caregiver and the minor parent (and any others in that household).
• If a caregiver temporarily does not reside with the child, include the caregiver in the household
unless there is substantial agreement that the caregiver will not return. (Examples include, but are
not limited to, following arrest, during an extended business trip or military deployment, or
following a crisis separation).
WHO IS INCLUDED AS A HOUSEHOLD MEMBER?
A household is a group of people, including the child, who typically reside together and function as a
family unit (e.g., share meals, spend time together, provide supervision and care). Household members
usually reside together; however:
• A non-resident is a household member if they have a familial or intimate relationship with an adult
living with the child AND have significant in-home contact with the child (e.g., a person who spends
50% or more time, on average, in the household but who may not actually live there); and
© 2023 Evident Change 3• A resident is not a household member if they function separately from the child (e.g., a tenant in the
residence who does not spend time with child).
WHICH HOUSEHOLD IS ASSESSED?
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
• SDM assessments are completed on the household(s) where there are allegations of abuse or
neglect.
• If a child is a member of more than one household, complete an SDM assessment for each separate
household for which there is alleged abuse or neglect.
DETAILED CONSIDERATIONS
• It does not matter which household is the household in which the child spends more time.
• Ideally, there is only one household with allegations in each referral and only one household with
allegations in each case.
• If a referral or case must include more than one household with allegations, there will be two sets of
SDM assessments in that referral or case.
» If household composition changes during an open referral or case, the next SDM assessment or
assessments are done on each household that includes a child and a person causing harm.
» If a child is being removed from a custodial parent, a global assessment of a non-custodial
parent identified may be completed if they will receive child welfare services, but an SDM
assessment is not required.

STEP I. PRELIMINARY SCREENING
REVIEW OF SCREENING CRITERIA IS NOT REQUIRED
Evaluate out.
No child under age 18
The current referral may allege abuse or neglect, but the alleged victim is 18 years of age or older.
Do not apply this item if the report concerns the death of the only child(ren) in the household where
death is suspected to be related to abuse or neglect, or for nonminor dependents reported to be
endangered by caregiver, per WIC 16504 (c).
Duplicate referral that contains no new information
The report duplicates an existing referral (this is commonly known as a secondary referral). This report
does not contain new allegations from an existing referral.
Referred to another county
A referral has been received for a child who lives in another county. The caller was both referred to that
county and provided with contact information, or the county was notified and the referral was recorded
in that county. Refer to local protocol for this type of referral.
Safely surrendered baby
The referral concerns a child 72 hours of age or younger whose caregiver has voluntarily surrendered
physical custody of the child to any employee on duty at a public or private hospital emergency room
or any additional site approved as a Safe Surrender Site. Follow procedures outlined in ACIN I-88-10.
© 2023 Evident Change A14STEP II. APPROPRIATENESS OF A CHILD ABUSE/NEGLECT REPORT FOR
RESPONSE
Determine if the report contains allegations of abuse or neglect in out-of-home care to a dependent or
ward child/youth.
A dependent or ward in out-of-home care is defined as a child/youth who is under the jurisdiction of
the county child welfare or probation department AND is currently placed in a licensed foster home,
group home, short-term residential therapeutic program, or residential treatment facility.
If yes: When applying definitions of screening and response priority tools, the definition of “caregiver”
should include “a person responsible for the child’s care and welfare (including a licensee, administrator,
or employee of any facility licensed to care for children)” in accordance with Cal. Penal Code § 11165.5.
If no: Apply screening and response priority tool definitions using the standard Structured Decision
Making® (SDM) definition of “caregiver.”
A. SCREENING CRITERIA (Elicit reporter’s concerns and select all that apply)
Consider age, developmental status, and other child vulnerabilities when assessing referrals for
allegations of abuse or neglect.
Physical Abuse (if not automatic 24-hour, go to physical abuse tree)
Non-accidental or suspicious injury
The child has a current or previously unreported injury or impairment AND the caregiver deliberately
caused the injury/impairment OR there is a basis to be suspicious that a caregiver caused it and it was
non-accidental. Basis for suspicion may include but is not limited to:
• Physician reports that the injury type is consistent with non-accidental injuries;
• Injury to a non-ambulatory child with no plausible alternative explanation;
• Explanation for injury does not match injury;
• Injury is in the shape of an object (e.g., loop marks); or
• Credible disclosure by the child to the reporting party or other adult.
Identify the type of non-accidental or suspicious physical injury.
© 2023 Evident Change A15Death of a child due to abuse (automatic 24-hour)
There was a death of a child in the home; and circumstances are suspicious for abuse, or abuse has
been identified as the cause of death in this report or investigation. Select one of the following options.
• Death of only child or all children in home; no other children reported to be in the home.
• Other children reported to be in the home.
Severe (automatic 24-hour)
A severe injury is one that, if left untreated, would cause permanent physical disfigurement, permanent
physical disability, or death. Include visible injuries and suspected injuries due to symptoms such as loss
of consciousness, altered mental status, inability to use an arm, inability to bear weight, etc.
Other injury (exclude very minor injuries unless the child is under 1 year old)
Any non-accidental or suspicious injury that is not severe.
Exclude very minor injuries, defined as those that involve only mild redness or swelling, minor
welts/scratches/abrasions, or brief and minor pain. Any non-accidental injury to a child under 1 year old
or a child who is non-ambulatory should not be considered very minor.
• “Other” injuries may require assessment/treatment but are not life-threatening and are not likely to
result in temporary or permanent disability or disfigurement. These may include bruises, welts, or
abrasions in areas of the body that do not pose a threat of serious injury or disfigurement (arms,
legs, buttocks).
Caregiver action that likely caused or will cause injury (exclude very minor injuries unless child is under
1 year old)
It is not necessary for a reporter to determine that an injury occurred. Examples of caregiver action that
is likely to have caused or will cause injury include but are not limited to the following:
• Shaking or throwing an infant or child under 3 years old.
• Inappropriate physical discipline, such as choking, suffocation, tying child up, locking child in
closet/kennel, physical activity exceeding child’s ability to perform, etc.
• Hitting a child with enough force or using objects to strike a child that could cause a significant
injury, such as a broken bone, concussion, significant bruising or lacerations, or internal injuries.
• Exposing a child to dangerous weather or environmental hazards (e.g., locking child out of the
home, confining child to garage with dangerous fumes/exhaust, dropping child off far from home
with no resources to get to a safe place).
© 2023 Evident Change A16• Dangerous behavior toward the child or in immediate proximity of the child, including violence by
one or more adult household members occurring while the child is present in ways that the child
could be physically injured. Consider combination of child location, type of incident (e.g., pushing,
throwing objects, use of a weapon), and child vulnerability.
• Caregiver has made credible threats to cause physical harm to the child that, if carried out, would
constitute child abuse, and it is likely that, without intervention, the caregiver will carry out these
threats. If threats are clearly for the sole purpose of emotional abuse, select “Caregiver actions
have led or are likely to lead to child’s severe anxiety, depression, withdrawal, or aggressive
behavior toward self or others” under emotional abuse. If the purpose cannot be discerned,
select both this section and the emotional abuse item mentioned above.
Prior death of a child due to abuse AND there is a new child of any age in the home
There was a death of a child in the home due to abuse or circumstances were suspicious for abuse prior
to the current referral AND there is a new child currently in the care of the identified/suspected
perpetrator.
Emotional Abuse (go to emotional abuse tree)
Caregiver actions have led or are likely to lead to child’s severe anxiety, depression, withdrawal, or
aggressive behavior toward self or others
Caregiver action(s), statement(s), or threat(s) have led or are likely to lead to child’s emotional damage
(e.g., severe anxiety, depression, withdrawal); behavioral concerns (e.g., untoward aggressive behavior
toward self or others); and/or adverse impact on the child’s emotional development, including but not
limited to delayed speech development, abnormal attachment behaviors, and impulse control
behaviors. The adverse impact may result from a single event or from a consistent pattern of behavior
and may be currently observed and/or predicted as supported by evidence-based practice. Types of
emotional maltreatment include but are not limited to the following:
• Rejecting and/or degrading the child.
• Isolating and/or victimizing the child by means of cruel, unusual, or excessive methods of discipline.
• Exposing the child to brutal or intimidating acts or statements, including but not limited to:
» Harm or threatened harm to animals;
» Threats of suicide or harm to family members (including the child);
» Confining the child in places such as closets or animal cages; or
» Consistently scapegoating the child; consistently berating, belittling, blaming, targeting, or
shaming the child.
The adverse impact on the child may or may not be apparent depending on the child’s age, cognitive
abilities, verbal ability, and developmental level. Adverse impact is not required if the action/inaction is
a single incident that demonstrates a serious disregard for the child’s welfare.
© 2023 Evident Change A17Emotional harm related to domestic violence
The child has experienced, or is likely to experience, emotional harm related to exposure to domestic
violence. The child may exhibit harm through symptoms of depression, significant anxiety or
withdrawal, or self-destructive or aggressive behavior from witnessing or intervening in physical
altercations, serious verbal threats, coercion, or intimidation by one adult household member against
another.
Note: If a child has been injured or is threatened with injury, also select “non-accidental or suspicious
injury” or “caregiver action that likely caused or will cause injury” under “Physical Abuse.”
Neglect
Severe neglect (if not automatic 24-hour, go to neglect tree)
Diagnosed malnutrition (automatic 24-hour)
The child has a current diagnosis by a qualified medical professional of severe malnutrition due to
inadequate or unbalanced diet, OR a qualified medical professional states that there are indicators of
malnutrition but a formal diagnosis has not yet been made.
Non-organic failure to thrive
The child has a current diagnosis by a qualified medical professional of non-organic failure to thrive, OR
a qualified medical professional states that there are indicators of failure to thrive but a formal
diagnosis has not yet been made.
Child’s health/safety is endangered
The caregiver has willfully not provided adequate clothing, shelter, supervision, care, or medical care
AND there is imminent danger of serious illness or injury; or serious illness, serious injury, or death has
already occurred. Consider child’s age, behavior, and vulnerability.
For example:
• The child’s clothing is so inappropriate for weather that the child suffered hypothermia or frostbite;
• Housing conditions result in lead poisoning, severely exacerbated asthma due to smoke exposure,
and/or multiple bites from pest infestations;
• There is methamphetamine production in the home/residence;
• Medical care has not been provided for an acute or chronic condition and, as a result, the child has
required or is likely to require hospitalization or surgery; or the condition may worsen to the extent
that unnecessary permanent disability, disfigurement, or death results;
© 2023 Evident Change A18• Caregiver is willfully not meeting child’s mental health needs and child has demonstrated suicidal or
homicidal behavior/ideation;
• Child is not supervised to the extent that the child has been seriously injured, is at risk of being
seriously injured, or avoided serious injury only due to intervention by a third party;
• A young child is left in a motor vehicle during extreme temperature conditions;
• A caregiver behaves recklessly in proximity to child (e.g., driving under the influence with a child in
the car, using weapons, etc.); or
• Caregiver is breastfeeding while using dangerous substances (type of substances and/or amount
resulted in or is likely to result in serious injury/illness to child).
Death of a child due to neglect (automatic 24-hour)
There has been a death of a child in the home due to neglect or circumstances that are suspicious for
neglect. Select one of the following options.
• Death of only child or all children in home; no other children reported to be in the home.
• Other children reported to be in the home.
General Neglect (go to neglect tree)
Consider age/developmental status of children. Minor or no injury or illness has occurred.
Note: General neglect does not include a parent’s economic disadvantage and should be limited to
circumstances in which the caregiver willfully or negligently fails to provide care. A child must be at
substantial risk of suffering serious physical harm or illness to fall within the definition of general
neglect (PC 11165.2, WIC 300(b)(1)(A-D)). This applies to all the following subcategories.
Inadequate food
The caregiver willfully or negligently failed to provide sufficient food to meet minimal requirements for
the child to maintain health and growth. The child experiences unmitigated hunger; lack of food has a
negative impact on school performance. Caregiver’s use of food stamps and/or food pantries as sources
of food should not be considered failure to provide food.
Inadequate clothing/hygiene
The caregiver has willfully or negligently failed to meet the child’s basic needs for clothing and/or
hygiene to the extent that the child’s daily activities are negatively impacted and/or the child develops
or suffers a worsening medical condition. Examples include but are not limited to:
• Sores, infection, or severe diaper rash;
© 2023 Evident Change A19• Inability to attend school due to persistent or recurring lack of clean clothing; and/or
• Experiencing shame or isolation from peers due to poor hygiene/extreme body odor.
Inadequate/hazardous shelter
The residence contains hazards that have led or could lead to injury or illness of the child if not
resolved. Examples include but are not limited to:
• Housing that is an acute fire hazard or has been condemned;
• Exposed heaters, gas fumes, or faulty electrical wiring;
• No utilities (e.g., water, electricity, heat source if needed) AND these are necessary based on current
conditions and age/developmental status or special needs of the child;
• Pervasive and/or chronic presence of rotting food, human/animal waste, or infestations;
• Presence of poisons, guns, or drugs within reach of child; and/or
• Lack of safe sleeping arrangements for infant/child.
Inadequate supervision
Caregiver is present but not attending to the child, or caregiver has made inadequate care
arrangements for the child. Injury has occurred due to lack of supervision or been avoided due to
third-party intervention. Examples include but are not limited to the following:
• Caregiver fell asleep in the apartment/house and young child wandered from the home into the
hallway/street.
• Child plays with dangerous objects (e.g., sharp knife, gun, matches).
• Non-mobile infant left in car seat or carrier for extended periods of time.
• Caregiver is unable to care for child due to substance use, mental illness, or developmental
disability.
• Caregiver does not protect child in the home from a sibling with violent behavior.
Inadequate medical/mental health care
Child has a mild to moderate condition, and the caregiver is not seeking or following medical
treatment, causing the child’s condition to deteriorate; OR the child has a severe, chronic condition and
the caregiver’s care is partial, but important components of the child’s medical needs are unmet.
© 2023 Evident Change A20Caregiver absence/abandonment
• Caregiver is unable to care for the child due to incarceration, hospitalization, or unavoidable
absence AND there is no safe adult to care for the child. If the caregiver is incarcerated,
hospitalized, or absent and has made a plan of care for the child with a safe adult or is otherwise
able to safely mitigate the impact of their absence on the child, this item should not be selected.
• Caregiver has deserted the child with no apparent plans for return. Abandonment may be indicated
by quitting jobs, establishing another residence, and taking clothing and other belongings.
• Child is being discharged from a facility and caregiver refuses to accept child back into their home
AND has not participated in discharge planning or caregiver cannot be found.
• Caregiver has kicked child out of the home/refuses child entry to the home and has not provided a
safe alternative.
• Caregiver left child with family or friends who state an intention to discontinue care and caregiver
refuses to accept child back or cannot be located.
• Child is or has been left without an identified caregiver for a period of time inappropriate to the
child’s age or developmental status. Consider presence of support systems such as relatives and
neighbors and child’s ability to access support systems by phone or access within immediate
walking distance.
Involving child in criminal activity
The caregiver causes the child to perform or participate in illegal acts that:
• Create danger of serious physical or emotional harm to the child;
• Expose the child to being arrested; or
• Force a child to act against their wishes.
Failure to protect
Note: Concerns related to domestic violence should be assessed under emotional abuse and physical
abuse items.
• Caregiver knowingly left child in the care of a person known to neglect or abuse children; a person
unknown to the caregiver; or a person known to be violent, use alcohol/drugs, or have serious
mental health concerns to the extent that their ability to provide care is significantly impaired;
• Caregiver does not intervene despite knowledge (or reasonable expectation that the caregiver
should have knowledge) that the child is being harmed (includes physical, sexual, or emotional
abuse or neglect) by another person;
OR
• A child has been exploited by a third party, and the person responsible for the child’s care is aware
of the exploitation and has not acted protectively. This includes situations where the person
responsible for the care of the child has been coerced or is otherwise complacent with exploitation.
© 2023 Evident Change A21Note: Screeners should explore a caregiver’s knowledge and protective actions prior to applying
allegations of failure to protect. Circumstances in which a child is trafficked and the caregiver may
have acted protectively but was unable to keep the child safe should be assessed under “sexual
exploitation: Child/youth is exploited or trafficked by someone other than a caregiver.”
» Children and youth aged 17 years old and younger are sexually exploited when they have
engaged in, solicited for, or been forced to engage in sexual conduct or performance of sexual
acts in return for a benefit, such as money, food, drugs, shelter, clothing, gifts, or other goods, or
for financial or some other gain for a third party. The sexual conduct may include any direct
sexual contact or performing any acts, sexual or nonsexual, for the sexual gratification of others.
These acts constitute sexual exploitation regardless of whether they are live, filmed, or
photographed.
Threat of Neglect (go to neglect tree)
No event has occurred; however, current conditions exist where, without intervention, the child will be
subject to one of the neglect categories above.
Prior failed reunification or severe neglect, and new child in household (in-home only)
There is credible information that a current caregiver had one or more children for whom there was:
• A failed reunification as a result of child abuse or neglect; OR
• A current caregiver was previously substantiated for severe neglect;
AND
• A new child is now living in the home and current conditions exist that create a substantial
likelihood that the child will be neglected.
Allowing child to use alcohol or other drugs
Caregiver provides (offers or knowingly allows the child to consume) alcohol, illegal drugs, or
inappropriate prescription drugs to a child to the extent that it could endanger the child’s physical
health or emotional well-being or result in exposure to danger because the child’s thinking and/or
behavior are impaired. Consider child’s age and substance type, including the following:
• Providing methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine, or similar drugs to a child of any age.
• Providing enough alcohol to result in intoxication.
• Providing alcohol over time so that the child is developing a dependency.
• Providing medications (includes prescription and over-the-counter) that are not prescribed for the
child, for the purpose of altering the child’s behavior or mood.
• Providing glue or other inhalants to a child of any age.
© 2023 Evident Change A22Examples of substance use that should not be included are:
• Use of small amounts of alcohol for religious ceremonies; and
• An older child is permitted to try a small amount of alcohol at a family occasion that did not result
in intoxication.
Prior death of a child due to neglect AND there is a new child of any age in the home (in-home only)
There has been a death of a child in the home due to neglect or circumstances are suspicious for
neglect prior to the current referral, AND new children are currently in the care of the
identified/suspected perpetrator.
Substance-affected newborn (in-home only)
There is an infant born and identified as affected by substance use
AND
There is indication that the caregiver will be unable to fulfill the basic needs of the infant upon
discharge from the hospital.
When assessing caregiver’s ability to provide minimum sufficient level of safe care, consider factors such
as willingness to implement a plan of safe care, demonstrations of safe care of other children, plans for
safe feeding, and availability of and willingness to use a support network.
Note: California defines an “infant born and identified as affected by substance abuse” as an infant
where substance exposure is indicated at birth AND subsequent assessment identifies indicators of risk
that may affect the infant’s health and safety. A positive toxicology screen at the time of the delivery of
an infant is not in and of itself an indication of neglect. Screeners should explore and document the
assessment completed pursuant to Section 123605 of the Health and Safety Code, which identifies
indicators of risk affecting the infant’s health and safety.
Other high-risk birth (in-home only)
No acts or omissions constituting neglect have yet occurred; however, conditions are present that
suggest that the only reasons neglect has not occurred are the external supports of the hospitalization
or the limited time since birth. Examples include but are not limited to the following:
• Sole caregiver or both caregivers have not attended to the newborn in the hospital.
• A caregiver with apparent physical, emotional, or cognitive limitations has no support system and
may be unable or unwilling to meet the newborn’s basic needs.
© 2023 Evident Change A23• A child was born with medical complications, and sole caregiver’s or both caregivers’ response
suggests caregiver(s) will be unable to meet the child’s exceptional needs (e.g., does not participate
in medical education to learn necessary care, indicates denial of diagnosis, etc.).
Sexual Abuse (go to sexual abuse tree)
Any sexual act on a child by an adult caregiver or other adult in the household, or unable to rule out
household member as alleged perpetrator
Based on verbal or nonverbal disclosure, medical evidence, or credible witnessed act. If child knows that
the alleged perpetrator is not a household member but does not know their identity, DO NOT SELECT.
Physical, behavioral, or suspicious indicators consistent with sexual abuse
Suspicious indicators include but are not limited to the following:
• Toddler or elementary school–aged child displays highly sexualized aggressive behaviors.
• Pre-adolescent child has initiated sexual acts or activities with caregivers, family members, or peers
that are outside age-appropriate exploration or development, and this has led to a concern that
they are a victim of sexual abuse.
• Child complains of pain in the genital or anal area AND there are other indications of sexual abuse.
Sexual act(s) among siblings or other children living in the home
Children living in the home engage in sexual behavior that is outside of normal exploration or involves
coercion or violence.
Sexual exploitation
Children and youth age 17 years and younger are sexually exploited when they have engaged in, been
solicited for, or been forced to engage in sexual conduct or performance of sexual acts in return for a
benefit—such as money, food, drugs, shelter, clothing, gifts, or other goods—or for financial or some
other gain for a third party. The sexual conduct may include any direct sexual contact or performing any
acts, sexual or nonsexual, for the sexual gratification of others. These acts constitute sexual exploitation
regardless of whether they are live, filmed, or photographed.
Caregiver actively involved child/youth in acts of exploitation or trafficking
Caregiver involves the child in obscene acts or engages the child in prostitution or pornography. This
includes a child being commercially sexually exploited and/or sex trafficked by or with knowledge and
© 2023 Evident Change A24consent of caregiver. In this circumstance, an allegation of sexual abuse should be applied to the
caregiver AND any third-party perpetrators.
Child/youth is exploited or trafficked by someone other than a caregiver
Child/youth is being commercially sexually exploited by a person who is not a caregiver.
Select if an in-person response is needed to assess the extent to which a caregiver has acted
protectively OR has the ability to protect the child from exploitation. If this item is selected, an
allegation of sexual abuse should be applied to only the alleged perpetrator(s) of the actual
exploitation. Do not apply an allegation of sexual abuse to the caregiver.
Threat of sexual abuse
No sexual act or exploitation has occurred; however, the caregiver behaves in ways that create a
substantial likelihood that the child will be sexually abused.
Known or highly suspected sexual abuse perpetrator lives with child
An individual with a known or suspected criminal history of sexual crime, regardless of whether they
have been arrested or convicted, lives in the same residence as the child.
Severely inappropriate sexual boundaries
Note: This does not include incidents that are accidental or inadvertent unless the report indicates that
the behavior is persistent or frequently occurring.
• Adults in the home allow children to see sexually explicit material, witness sexual acts, or hear sexual
language that is inappropriate to their age/developmental status.
AND
• This has resulted in the child exhibiting age-inappropriate sexual behavior OR emotional distress.
• Adult(s) in the household exhibits behaviors suggesting the purpose is sexual gratification for the
adult.
B. SCREENING DECISION

home care to a dependent or ward child/youth
Local protocol determines that an agency such as law enforcement, probation, or court will be the
investigating entity for this issue AND a child welfare response is not required. Cross-report to law
enforcement or the appropriate agency as required by state regulation.
Historical information only
Child is at least 10 years old AND the alleged maltreatment occurred more than one year ago, AND
there were no reports of abuse or neglect since the alleged incident, AND the conditions that
contributed to the alleged incident are no longer present. If reported incident is sexual abuse, all of the
above criteria must apply AND the reported perpetrator must be either an unidentifiable non-
household member or deceased.

CAREGIVER
An adult, parent, or guardian in the household who provides care and supervision for the child.
For the purpose of scoring several items on the risk assessment, if a household includes more than one
caregiver, it is necessary to designate one caregiver as primary and one as secondary. This is done using
the following decision tree.
1. Is caregiver the only caregiver with legal responsibility for child?
a. If yes, the answer is Primary.
b. If no, go to Question 2.
2. Does caregiver provide more care for child?
a. If yes, the answer is Primary.
b. If no, go to Question 3.
3. Is caregiver more responsible for reported harm to child?
a. If yes, the answer is Primary.
b. If no, the answer is Secondary.
FACILITY CAREGIVER
A person responsible for the child/youth’s care and welfare (including a licensee, administrator,
employee, volunteer, contractor, etc., of any facility licensed to care for children/youth) in accordance
with California Penal Code § 11165.5.
FACILITY LEADERSHIP
A facility caregiver in a leadership position who can make or support a change to facility policy, practice,
or care and/or implement a safety plan.
FAMILY
Parents, adults fulfilling the parental role, guardians, children, and others related by ancestry, adoption,
or marriage; or as defined by the family itself.

A household is a group of people, including the child, who typically reside together and function as a
family unit (e.g., share meals, spend time together, provide supervision and care). Household members
usually reside together; however:
• A non-resident is a household member if they have a familial or intimate relationship with an adult
living with the child AND have significant in-home contact with the child (e.g., a person who spends
50% or more time, on average, in the household but who may not actually live there); and
• A resident is not a household member if they function separately from the child (e.g., a tenant in the
residence who does not spend time with child).
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
Domestic violence (including intimate partner violence) includes circumstances in which one person
chooses a pattern of behavior that exerts coercive power and control over the other person. As a result,
family functioning is disrupted, and the child is or may be adversely impacted.
The perpetrator’s pattern of behavior may include physical violence; emotional abuse; sexual abuse;
constraining family or social relationships; controlling finances; undermining the victim’s parenting,
sobriety, or mental health; disrupting housing or creating housing instability; or any other behavior that
has the impact of gaining power over or control of the victim.
IMMINENT DANGER OF SERIOUS HARM
Safety threats indicate an imminent danger of serious harm. This means that facility conditions or
facility caregiver actions, omissions, or responses endanger the life or seriously jeopardize the physical
or emotional health or overall safety of the children/youth in care.
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE
An adult household member physically assaults another adult household member. This violence may be
in the context of domestic violence (i.e., pattern of behavior that exerts coercive power and control) OR
may have no element of power and control. Household violence may be a single event or a pattern.
SUBSTANCE ABUSE
A caregiver’s recurring use of alcohol or drugs causes functionally significant impairments, such as
health problems, disability, or failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or home.
