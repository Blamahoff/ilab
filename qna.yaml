      Intake assessment is a critical decision point in child welfare service.
      It consists of two main sections: screening and response priority. The     
      screening section helps child abuse hotline workers determine whether
      the current report meets criteria for a child protective services (CPS) 
      investigation. This includes evaluating the alleged abuse or neglect, the 
      vulnerability of the child, and the caregiver's capacity. The response 
      priority section guides workers in determining how urgently an accepted 
      report must be investigated, based on the level of immediate danger and 
      risk to the child.

      - question: |
          What is the purpose of the screening section in the intake assessment?
        answer: |
          The screening section helps hotline workers determine whether a report 
          meets the criteria for a CPS investigation by evaluating the nature of 
          the allegations, child vulnerability, and caregiver capability.
      - question: |
          What does the response priority section determine in intake assessment?
        answer: |
          The black-capped chickadee is well known for its vocalizations,
          The response priority section determines how quickly a CPS investigation 
          must begin, based on the urgency and risk of harm to the child. 
      - question: |
          What factors are considered when screening a child abuse report?
        answer: |
          Factors include the type and severity of alleged abuse or neglect, 
          the age and vulnerability of the child, and the caregiver's ability to 
          protect the child.
  - context: |
       The Safety Assessment is used throughout a child welfare case to help  
       worker determine whether a child can safely remain in the home. 
       It evaluates present danger, caregiver protective capacities, and the need 
       for a safety plan. The tool also includes a secondary version tailored for 
       children placed in foster or substitute care, ensuring consistent safety 
       decisions across various settings. The safety assessment is critical in 
       identifying immediate threats to a child’s well-being and determining if 
       protective actions or removals are necessary.

      - question: |
          What is the purpose of the safety assessment in child welfare?
        answer: |
          The safety assessment helps determine if a child can safely remain in the 
          home and whether a safety plan is needed to manage any threats.
      - question: |
          When is a safety assessment used in a case?
        answer: |
          It is used at various points in a child welfare case to evaluate safety 
          throughout the life of the case, not just at intake.
      - question: |
          What does the safety assessment evaluate?
        answer: |
          It evaluates current threats to a child’s safety, caregiver protective 
          capacity, and the need for immediate intervention or a safety plan.

  - context: |
      The Risk Assessment is an actuarial tool used by child welfare investigators
      to estimate the likelihood of future involvement with the child welfare system. 
      It guides decision-making on whether a case should be closed or continued for 
      ongoing services. By examining family history, current circumstances, and known 
      risk factors, the tool supports consistent and evidence-based decisions about 
      child safety and service needs.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
           What is the purpose of the risk assessment in child welfare?
        answer: |
          The risk assessment estimates the likelihood of future child welfare 
          involvement to help determine whether a case should continue for services 
          or be closed.

      - question: |
           When is the risk assessment used?
        answer: |
          It is typically used at the conclusion of an investigation to guide case 
          disposition decisions.
      - question: |
           How does the risk assessment support child welfare decisions?
        answer: |
          It provides an objective estimate of future risk, helping ensure that high-risk 
          families receive continued services while low-risk cases may be safely closed.

  - context: |
      The Family Strengths and Needs Assessment (FSNA) informs case planning by helping 
      child welfare workers systematically assess the strengths and needs of family 
      caregivers and all children. It uses a standardized set of family functioning domains 
      to guide the evaluation process. This structured approach supports the identification 
      of priority areas that should be addressed in the case plan to enhance family functioning 
      and promote child safety.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of the Family Strengths and Needs Assessment (FSNA)?
        answer: |
          The FSNA supports case planning by identifying key strengths and priority needs within 
          a family, guiding interventions to improve functioning and safety.
      - question: | 
           Who is assessed in the FSNA?
        answer: |
           The assessment includes all family caregivers and children involved in the case.
      - question: |
          How does the FSNA support case planning?
        answer: |
          It structures the evaluation of family functioning and helps prioritize areas to target in 
          the case plan to improve child safety and family stability.
