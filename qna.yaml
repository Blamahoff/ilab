  - context: |
      Intake assessment is a critical decision point in child welfare
      service. It consists of two main sections: screening and response
      priority. The screening section helps child abuse hotline workers
      determine whether the current report meets criteria for a child
      protective services (CPS) investigation. This includes evaluating the
      alleged abuse or neglect, the vulnerability of the child, and the
      caregiver's capacity. The response priority section guides workers in
      determining how urgently an accepted report must be investigated,
      based on the level of immediate danger and risk to the child.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of the screening section in the intake
          assessment?
        answer: |
          The screening section helps hotline workers determine whether a
          report meets the criteria for a CPS investigation by evaluating the
          nature of the allegations, child vulnerability, and caregiver
          capability.
      - question: |
          What does the response priority section determine in intake
          assessment?
        answer: |
          The response priority section determines how quickly a CPS
          investigation must begin, based on the urgency and risk of harm to
          the child.
      - question: |
          What factors are considered when screening a child abuse report?
        answer: |
          Factors include the type and severity of alleged abuse or neglect,
          the age and vulnerability of the child, and the caregiver's ability
          to protect the child.
      - question: |
          When is a report assigned a high response priority?
        answer: |
          A report is assigned a high response priority when there is an
          immediate or severe risk to the child's safety or well-being that
          requires urgent investigation.
      - question: |
          Why is the intake assessment important in child welfare?
        answer: |
          It ensures that serious cases of abuse or neglect are identified
          quickly and receive an appropriate and timely CPS response to
          protect children.
  - context: |
      The Safety Assessment is used throughout a child welfare case to help
      workers determine whether a child can safely remain in the home. It
      evaluates present danger, caregiver protective capacities, and the need
      for a safety plan. The tool also includes a secondary version tailored
      for children placed in foster or substitute care, ensuring consistent
      safety decisions across various settings. The safety assessment is
      critical in identifying immediate threats to a child’s well-being and
      determining if protective actions or removals are necessary.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of the safety assessment in child welfare?
        answer: |
          The safety assessment helps determine if a child can safely remain
          in the home and whether a safety plan is needed to manage any
          threats.
      - question: |
          When is a safety assessment used in a case?
        answer: |
          It is used at various points in a child welfare case to evaluate
          safety throughout the life of the case, not just at intake.
      - question: |
          What does the safety assessment evaluate?
        answer: |
          It evaluates current threats to a child’s safety, caregiver
          protective capacity, and the need for immediate intervention or a
          safety plan.
      - question: |
          Can a child remain in the home with safety concerns present?
        answer: |
          Yes, if a protective safety plan can be implemented and the
          caregivers are willing and able to follow it.
      - question: |
          Is there a different safety assessment for children in foster care?
        answer: |
          Yes, a version of the safety assessment has been developed
          specifically for use in foster and substitute care settings.
  - context: |
      The Risk Assessment is an actuarial tool used by child welfare
      investigators to estimate the likelihood of future involvement with the
      child welfare system. It guides decision-making on whether a case
      should be closed or continued for ongoing services. By examining family
      history, current circumstances, and known risk factors, the tool
      supports consistent and evidence-based decisions about child safety and
      service needs.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of the risk assessment in child welfare?
        answer: |
          The risk assessment estimates the likelihood of future child
          welfare involvement to help determine whether a case should
          continue for services or be closed.
      - question: |
          When is the risk assessment used?
        answer: |
          It is typically used at the conclusion of an investigation to guide
          case disposition decisions.
      - question: |
          How does the risk assessment support child welfare decisions?
        answer: |
          It provides an objective estimate of future risk, helping ensure
          that high-risk families receive continued services while low-risk
          cases may be safely closed.
      - question: |
          What factors are considered in a risk assessment?
        answer: |
          The assessment includes factors such as prior reports, caregiver
          characteristics, family stressors, and current incident details.
      - question: |
          How is the risk assessment different from a safety assessment?
        answer: |
          A safety assessment focuses on immediate threats to a child’s
          well-being, while a risk assessment estimates the likelihood of
          future involvement with the system.

      The Family Strengths and Needs Assessment (FSNA) is an evaluative tool
      used to assess the family’s strengths, challenges, and overall
      functioning. It helps social workers identify areas that need
      improvement and the resources that can be mobilized to address family
      challenges. The FSNA includes areas like family dynamics, mental
      health, substance abuse, and economic stability. It is used to inform
      case plans and prioritize interventions to improve family functioning
      and well-being.

      The Reunification Assessment is designed for families whose children
      are in out-of-home care with a goal of reunification. This structured
      tool assists child welfare workers in determining whether a child can
      safely return home or whether a change in the permanency goal should be
      considered. The assessment includes three key sections: evaluation of
      current risk, caregiver-child visitation quality, and an updated safety
      determination.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of the Reunification Assessment?
        answer: |
          It helps child welfare workers decide whether a child in out-of-
          home care can safely return home or if a new permanency plan should
          be explored.
      - question: |
          What are the three sections of the Reunification Assessment?
        answer: |
          The assessment includes risk evaluation, caregiver-child visitation
          assessment, and a current safety assessment.
      - question: |
          When is the Reunification Assessment used?
        answer: |
          It is used during the case planning process for children in out-of-
          home care when the goal is reunification.
      - question: |
          How does the assessment support safe reunification?
        answer: |
          By systematically reviewing safety, risk, and relationship quality,
          the tool ensures that all factors are considered before returning a
          child home.
      - question: |
          What happens if the assessment suggests reunification is not safe?
        answer: |
          Workers may recommend a change in permanency goal, such as adoption
          or guardianship.
